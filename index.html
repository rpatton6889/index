            <h3>Dribbling</h3>
            <p>
                Use your fingertips, keep the ball low, and keep your eyes up.
                Strong dribbling lets you control the game instead of the ball 
                controlling you.

            <h3>Shooting</h3>
            <p>
                Focus on balance, elbow under the ball, and a smooth follow-through.
                Good form matters more than distance when you are starting out.

            <h3>Defense</h3>
            <p>
                Stay low in a stance, slide your feet, and stay between your player
                and the basket. Great defense creates easy offense.

        <h2>Why Fundamentals Matter</h2>
        <p>
            Every great player started with the basics. Practicing simple,
            repeatable skills helps you build muscle memory so that
            dribbling, shooting, and defense feel natural during games.
